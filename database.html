		<h4> Agriculture in Spain</h4>
				<p>
The first useful agricultural area in the EU-15,With 25 million hectares covering 50% of its territory,
Spain has, before France, the largest UAA in the EU. to 15 (21%). In particular, it has 18 million
hectares of cultivated land (including 4.3 million irrigated hectares) and 7 million hectares of
meadows and pastures.
Although the position of farming has declined, it remains a significant part of Spain’s national
economy and landscape. Spain has more than 29 million acres (11.7 million hectares) under
permanent crops, the largest such area in Europe. About 6 percent of Spain’s workers are employed
in agriculture, and they produce about 3 percent of the county’s GDP.
The fourth final agricultural production in the EU: Production in the agricultural industry in 2004
stood at 39 billion euros (+ 60.3% compared to 1990), or 3.4% of Spanish GDP. The country
contributes to 12% of the Community&#39;s Final Agricultural Production and is thus placed in 4th place
within the countries of the European Union. The sectoral distribution of agricultural production
shows a predominance of crop production which constitutes 58.7% of production against 41.3% for
livestock, this proportion changing little. Spain is the second beneficiary country of the CAP with 6.34
billion euros in EAGGF-Guarantee revenue in the agricultural sector in 2004. </p>

<h4>Fruits &amp; Vegetables</h4>
<p> 
Widespread irrigation has enabled Spain to grow almost all known varieties of fruit and
vegetables. However, tradition still plays a part in what is grown in each region. A never-
ending, flavorful and healthy supply.</p>
<h4>Vegetables</h4>
<p> 
Spain’s plentiful vegetable and fruit crops traditionally supplied a wealth of products needing
preservation so that they could be consumed year-round. With the invention of canning and
sterilization systems in the 19th century, small-scale, family-run businesses developed,
forming the backbone of what were to become large vegetable processing companies. These
have now existed for decades and are mostly located in the areas where the products are
grown. The leaders in this sector are the regions of Murcia and Valencia, followed by the
Ebro valley or, more specifically, Navarre and La Rioja. The latter have a longstanding
tradition in the production of vegetable preserves, especially asparagus, peppers and
artichokes. Other regions growing and canning vegetables are Extremadura, Aragón, the two
Castiles, Andalusia and Catalonia. Many tomato preserves are also produced all over Spain.
Some of the most famous Spanish vegetable preserves are the PDO Pimiento del Piquillo de
Lodosa peppers from Navarre. Although virtually inedible when fresh, after roasting, hand
peeling and canning, they become an outstanding delicacy with a silky texture and complex
flavor – sweet, fragrant and just slightly hot.
Another well-known variety of pepper used for roasting and canning are those from Nájera

(La Rioja), which are the basis for PGI Pimiento Riojano. Others are the roasted Bierzo
peppers from PGI Pimiento Asado del Bierzo in León.
Another prized vegetable for canning is asparagus, and particularly those from La Rioja,
Aragón and PGI Espárrago de Navarra in Navarre. Other stalk vegetables like cardoon and
borage are also canned in this part of Spain. Canned artichokes are considered a delicacy, and
particularly those from Tudela in Navarre which have PGI Alcachofa de Tudela status.</p>

<h4>Fruit</h4>
<p>Spain’s privileged location in the Mediterranean basin allows it to produce almost ten million
tons of fruit annually. Approximately five to ten per cent of this is processed, mainly as
preserves, making Spain one of Europe’s main producers and exporters of canned fruit.
Production mostly takes place in the region of Murcia, with peaches (the star product),
mandarins, apricots and pears being the most important. Some sub-tropical fruits such as
mango and papaya are also produced in canned form.
Spain’s plentiful vegetable and fruit crops, fish captures and meat elaboration methods
traditionally supplied a wealth of products needing preservation so that they could be
consumed year-round.</p>

<h4>Growing animal productions</h4>
<p>Meat production reached 5.37 million tonnes in 2004; this figure has been increasing in recent years.
Pig production represents around 10% of final Spanish agricultural production. In 2004, Spain
produced 15% of EU pigmeat, or 3.2 million tonnes. The herd is growing; it represented 25.4 million
head in 2004, making it the second EU herd with 17% of the EU herd. Spain, which now has the most
competitive pork sector in Europe, is also the leading consumer of pork in the EU (over 66 kg per
person per year).
The cattle herd was 6.7 million head in 2004, including 1.06 million dairy cows. The dairy herd is
steadily declining. For its part, the suckler herd is progressing slowly, in particular due to restricted
premium rights; fattening is gradually developing in the beef breed areas, the main areas of
intensive fattening still in Catalonia. Beef production reached 716,000 tonnes in 2004 (2.3 million
head), or 9% of EU production. Since November 22, 2000 (date of the announcement of the first
case), the Spanish cattle herd is no longer free from BSE (137 cases in 2004).
The Spanish milk quota was set at 6.12 million tonnes from April 1, 2001. There are around 34,000
farmers delivering milk (a marked decrease), the average quota per farm being 177,000 kg.
Production is concentrated three-quarters in the Cantabrian cornice. 70% of farms benefit from a
quota that does not reach the national average, while 2% of producers concentrate 20% of the
quotas. A restructuring plan for the dairy sector was implemented in 2005 to encourage the
expansion of farms whose size was too small and threatened profitability. With 253,000 tonnes in 2004, Spanish sheep and goat meat production represented 22% of Community production. In 2004, the sheep population was 23.5 million heads and the goat
population 3.16 million heads. The slight decrease in livestock in 2004 (which had increased by 50%
in 30 years) is explained by the reappearance of bluetongue in Andalusia in 2004.
Poultry meat production reached 1.31 million tonnes (14% of EU production) and egg production
1.13 billion dozen (13% of EU production) in 2004 These two productions are growing.
Total agri-food exports in 2004 were € 21.9 billion and imports were € 20.2 billion. The agro-food
balance was positive for the ninth consecutive year at 1.7 billion euros, which allows Spain to reduce
its overall deficit in foreign trade. The share of exports in Final Agricultural Production is around
56%. On the contrary, the trade balance of the non-food subsector was negative. The products
contributing most significantly to this deficit are tobacco (cigars, cigarettes), wood, skins and cotton.</p>

<h4>Area and Production</h4>
<p>Spain is the EU’s second largest cotton growing Member State after Greece.  Spain’s cotton
production accounts for just above 20 percent of the EU-28 cotton output.  Cotton production
in Spain is concentrated in the Guadalquivir Valley, Andalucía, Spain’s southernmost region. 
The majority of the production is located in the Andalusian provinces of Seville and Cadiz,
and to a lesser extent, Cordoba and Jaen.  From an environmental, social and economic
perspective, cotton is a critical crop in the areas where it is grown as viable crop alternatives
are limited.  Virtually all cotton in Spain is cultivated under irrigation.
Spain’s cotton area is highly inelastic. It is grown under salty and warm conditions, and there
are little alternative crops that can be profitable under these circumstances.  However, slight
area variations can occur, depending on water supplies, price relations, and competition from
other crops.  To a certain extent, available subsidies also play a role in planting decisions.
The implementation of the EU cotton reform in 2006 resulted in a significant reduction in
cotton planted area, which reached a record low in marketing year 2008/09.  The amendments
introduced by Regulation (EC) 637/2008 resulted in an area recovery until marketing year
2014/15 when cotton area hit its highest level in 9 years.  The downwards revision of the
reference amount for area payments resulted in a new drop in the cotton planted area, which
has stabilized around 63,000 Ha.  (For additional information, see Policy Section)</p>
